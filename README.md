# Visualization Comprehension Scatterplots Dataset
A dataset for studying the effect of data size and pattern salience on general users' comprehension of visualization, especially the efficiency and accuracy of intermediate-level scatterplot tasks.

## File Structure
- `./material`: This folder includes all visualization examples we collected for the 18 subtypes.

- `./paticipant_answers`: This folder includes the answers of all 54 participants in the experiment.

- `./processed_data (npy)`: This folder includes the processed .npy files. Each file contains the two dimensions we extracted from the raw .csv files.

- `./raw_data (csv)`: This folder includes the raw .csv files we used to generate the test dataset. All the files in this folder are downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/). The data in "7.csv" is used as the dataset for the training section.

- `./scatterplots (png)`: This folder includes all scatterplots we used for the experiment.

- `./paper appendix.pdf`: This file contains the appendices (including the visualization examples used in the pilot study, the result of visualization difficulty of the pilot study, and the system interface of the formal experiment) of the paper.

- `./task.json`: This file contains the questions we designed for each scatterplot in `./scatterplots (png)`.
