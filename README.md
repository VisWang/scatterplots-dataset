# Visualization Comprehension Scatterplots Dataset
A dataset for studying the effect of data size and pattern salience on general users' comprehension of visualization, especially the efficiency and accuracy of intermediate-level scatterplot tasks.

## File Structure
- `./raw_data (csv)`: This folder includes the raw .csv files we used to generate the test dataset. All the files in this folder are downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/). The data in "7.csv" is used as the dataset for the training section.

- `./processed_data (npy)`: This folder includes the processed .npy files. Each file contains the two dimensions we extracted from the raw .csv files.

- `./scatterplots (png)`: This folder includes all scatterplots we used for the experiment.
